## ✨ Why Claude Cowork?

Claude Code is powerful — but it **only runs in the terminal**.

That means:
- ❌ No visual feedback for complex tasks
- ❌ Hard to track multiple sessions
- ❌ Tool outputs are inconvenient to inspect

**Open Claude Cowork solves these problems:**

- 🖥️ Runs as a **native desktop application**
- 🤖 Acts as your **AI collaboration partner** for any task
- 🔁 Reuses your **existing `~/.claude/settings.json`**
- 🧠 **100% compatible** with Claude Code

If Claude Code works on your machine —  
**Open Claude Cowork works too.**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### better-sqlite3 Module Error

If you encounter an error like:

```
Error: The module was compiled against a different Node.js version using
NODE_MODULE_VERSION 127. This version of Node.js requires NODE_MODULE_VERSION 140.
```

This happens because Electron bundles its own Node.js version and native modules need to be recompiled for it.

**Solution:**

```bash
# Install electron-rebuild as a dev dependency
npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild

# Rebuild better-sqlite3 for Electron
npx electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3

# Run the app again
bun run dev
```

This ensures that native modules are compiled against Electron's Node.js version rather than your system's Node.js version.
